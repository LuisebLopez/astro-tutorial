Well this is the last post to this blog, I _finally complete_ it, I hope you can follow me on new adventures

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

4. **Interaction Between Pages**: I learned to link pages between them and to link them by using the tags of the posts.

## What's next

Now is time to make my own project, It will be about me, It's gonna be like a portfolio. Thank you for following me on this journey. `See you on the next one!`
